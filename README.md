<h1>Webserver </h1>

This is a web server crafted in Java.
This tool is build as part of <a href="https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-webserver">coding challenges</a> ,to build our own web server.


```
At its core a web server is actually quite simple. It’s a server that listens for connections from clients and responds to them. The clients make those requests using a protocol known as HTTP (and expect responses in the same protocol, obviously).

HTTP like many early Unix and Internet protocols is text based, so human readable. The original HTTP specification from 1991, is short and sweet. It originally didn’t even have a version number! But was later renamed HTTP/0.9, to differentiate it from HTTP/1.0. The HTTP/1.0 specification seems to be lost in the mists of time.

The first full formal HTTP specification is HTTP/1.1 - also known as - RFC2616 from 1999. You can dig through all the HTTP standards on the W3C website.

step 2: click and run the main.java file to start the project

Step 3: As soon as the java program run ,yoou need to go to local server 
```http://localhost/```

Then you will get the server client connection established and you can perform changes as mentioned in coding challeges .
